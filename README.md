# 🚀 HireQ (Job Seeker & Recruiter Web App)

This is a minimalistic, responsive web application built using **Next.js**, **Convex**, **Firebase**, **Clerk**, and **Google Generative AI**. The main purpose of this project is to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for job seekers and recruiters to analyze resumes (CVs) based on job descriptions. The app is designed to analyze ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores and offer detailed feedback and suggestions for job seekers.

### 🧑‍💻 Project Overview

I built this project to solve a common problem, which i encountered while searching for a job. Many ATS-checking websites lack good UI and user experience, with many built using frameworks like Streamlit and Python. I wanted to create a clean, intuitive platform with great user experience where users can check their ATS score and improve their resumes.

The app allows users to sign up or log in and choose between two roles: **Recruiter** or **Job Seeker**. The Recruiter role allows you to view resumes/CVs submitted by job seekers, filter them by skills, and access them via PDF links. The Job Seeker role allows users to upload their resume (CV), input a job description, and analyze their resume using generative AI to get tips, suggestions, and an ATS score.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Login or sign up using **Clerk** (Firebase Authentication alternative).
- 🧑‍💼👩‍💻 **Role Selection**: After logging in, users can choose whether they are a **Recruiter** or a **Job Seeker**.
  - **Recruiters** can view job seekers' resumes and filter by skills.
  - **Job Seekers** can upload their resume and analyze it against a job description.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Resume analysis is powered by **Google Generative AI**, **OpenAI**, or **Hugging Face** (based on configuration in `.env`).
- 📊 **ATS Score**: Job seekers can receive an ATS score based on how well their resume matches a job description.
- 💡 **Suggestions & Feedback**: Detailed suggestions, tips, and graphical representation of how the resume matches the job description.
- ✉️ **Resume Sending**: Job seekers can send their resumes to recruiters (one resume per recruiter).
- 🎯 **Quiz**: Job seekers can take a quiz based on the job description to prepare for interviews.
- 📱💻**Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for a seamless experience on mobile and desktop.
